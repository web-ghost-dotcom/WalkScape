# WalkScape Solidity Contracts

A comprehensive blockchain-based gaming ecosystem built on Base Sepolia network, featuring player progression, collectible artifacts, virtual pets, social colonies, and staking mechanics.

## 🌟 Features

- **Player Management**: Registration, XP tracking, health scores, and progress streaks
- **Artifact Collection**: Location-based NFT-like collectibles with rarity system
- **Pet System**: Mintable pets with feeding, evolution, and special traits
- **Colony System**: Social groups with shared XP and member management
- **Staking Rewards**: Long-term staking with growth multipliers and special rewards
- **Touch Grass Check-ins**: Location-based check-ins with streak bonuses

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for deployment (required)
- `ADMIN_ADDRESS`: Admin address (optional, defaults to deployer)
- `BASESCAN_API_KEY`: API key for contract verification (optional)

### Network Configuration

The contracts are configured for Base Sepolia testnet:
- **RPC URL**: `https://sepolia.base.org`
- **Chain ID**: `84532`
- **Explorer**: `https://sepolia.basescan.org`

## 📖 Contract Architecture

### WalkScapeCore.sol

Main contract containing all game logic:

#### Core Structs
- `PlayerStats`: Player progression and statistics
- `ArtifactData`: Collectible artifact information
- `PetStats`: Virtual pet attributes and status
- `ColonyStats`: Social group information
- `StakeInfo`: Staking rewards and multipliers

#### Key Functions

**Player Management**
- `registerPlayer()`: Register new player
- `updateWalkXp()`: Update player XP
- `touchGrassCheckin()`: Location-based check-in

**Artifact System**
- `claimArtifact()`: Claim artifact at location
- `transferArtifact()`: Transfer artifact ownership
- `getPlayerArtifacts()`: Get player's artifacts

**Pet System**
- `mintPet()`: Mint new pet (costs 100 XP)
- `feedPet()`: Feed pet to maintain happiness
- `evolvePet()`: Evolve pet when requirements met

**Colony System**
- `createColony()`: Create new social group
- `joinColony()`: Join existing colony
- `leaveColony()`: Leave current colony

**Staking System**
- `stakeForGrowth()`: Stake tokens for rewards
- `harvestGrowthReward()`: Claim staking rewards

## 📊 Game Mechanics

### XP System
- Base XP gain: 10 per grass touch
- Streak bonus: +5 XP per streak level
- Pet minting cost: 100 XP

### Artifact Rarity
- Base rarity depends on player XP level
- Location-based randomness modifier
- Rarity levels: 1-5 stars

### Pet Evolution
- Requires level 10+ and 80+ happiness
- Unlocks special traits
- Resets level but increases evolution stage

### Staking Multipliers
- 100+ tokens: 1.5x multiplier
- 500+ tokens: 2x multiplier  
- 1000+ tokens: 3x multiplier

### Colony Benefits
- Shared XP accumulation
- Social interaction features
- Maximum 50 members per colony

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, verify your contract:
```bash
make verify CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... NETWORK=base-sepolia
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Local Development

Start local node:
```bash
make local-node
```

Deploy locally with test data:
```bash
make local-deploy
```

### Code Quality

Format code:
```bash
make format
```

Lint code:
```bash
make lint
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Uses OpenZeppelin security modules (ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, Ownable)
- Input validation on all public functions
- Proper access control for admin functions
- Safe arithmetic operations
- Comprehensive test coverage

## 🚀 Deployment Example

Complete deployment process:

```bash
# Set environment
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Build and test
make build test

# Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet with verification
make base-sepolia

# Or deploy with test data for development
make test-deploy

# Verify deployment
make contract-info CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

The deployment will output:
- Contract address
- Admin address  
- Network information
- Next steps for frontend integration
